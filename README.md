# Data Flow Atlas

**An Atlas of data points, data layers, and data flows** for your web or mobile app.

    > Do you know where all your data is at?

The contents in this README.md ([below](#todos-bugs-and-releases)) details **tasks to be done**, **bugs**, and current and past **releases** of the app.

The full description of this app can be found in the [app's README.md](app/README.md)

  - Excerpt:
    - This app is a web-based application for manually cataloging and organizing application data flows across multiple layers. Some examples might include:
      - Nuxt web app or SPA:
        - Pinia stores, models, composables, middleware, plugins, browser local and session storage, backend APIs, databases, etc.
      - Flutter mobile app:
        - Shared Preferences, Flutter Secure Storage, models, changeNotifiers, blocs, repositories, backend APIs, databases, server instances, Firebase stores, etc.
    - A **structured, manually curated system of record** for understanding your app's *data domains and flows*, without drowning in ad-hoc notes or spaghetti diagrams.
    - Basically an “architectural logbook” for all your app's data layers.
