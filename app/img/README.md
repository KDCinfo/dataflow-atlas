### Attribution:

1. The [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) app was used to design the logo.
2. Photoshop Elements 2023 was used to trim the the exported drawio PNG image to 140x140 and save it back to a transparent PNG via the 'save for web' option.
3. The black globe used in the final logo was provided by Openclipart under the "Creative Commons Zero" license (meaning attribution is nice but not necessary).
